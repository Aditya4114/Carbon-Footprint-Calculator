This project is a web-based carbon footprint calculator that helps users estimate their personal carbon emissions.

## Live Demo

## How It Works

The calculator takes into account various factors that contribute to an individual's carbon footprint, such as:

1. Transportation habits
2. Energy consumption
3. Diet choices

Users input their data into the calculator, which then processes this information to provide an estimate of their annual carbon emissions in metric tons of CO2.
